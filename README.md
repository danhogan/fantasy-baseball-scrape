# fantasy-baseball-scrape

This is just something I used to scrape some data for ESPN Fantasy Baseball.
There needs to be a few things changed to make it more easily reusable as many things are still hardcoded for my specific league.
I hope to try doing something similar to this using artoo.js and make something more reusable/instantly usable on github pages with that.
